# 🎮 Task-02: Guessing Game  

This project is part of the **Prodigy Internship Task-02**.  
The goal is to build a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it.

- Prompt the user to input their guess.  
- Compare it with the generated number.  
- Provide feedback if the guess is **too high** or **too low**.  
- Continue until the user correctly guesses the number.  
- Display the number of attempts it took to win the game.
